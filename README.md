# Duality of Nature

Pixelated interactive Art Piece

## Brief Description

This is my attempt to portray human interference with Mother Nature and how nature strives to work and grow around it. The interaction of the slider suggests how we as humans have the ability to continually change our environment for better or worse. This illustration is created in pixelated art, making it simple and comforting to look at, while also depicting a tech‑littered world.

## Difficulties

With this assignment, the difficulties would be overwhelmed by the aspirations of this project, stressing to make complex functions and multiple layers of media. Keeping it simple made it more enjoyable in the art process. I would have liked to dive into this project more with the art and animate animals such as squirrels, animate falling leaves, and also to animate rain. Due to my unfortunate start of this semester, becoming badly sick, it had stressed me out to catch up with a month's amount of teaching while also doing assignments. Keeping it simple encouraged me to learn and develop my art skills and how I can use it alongside p5 to make a slightly interactive and fun concept come to life.
